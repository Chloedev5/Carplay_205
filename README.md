# Carplay_205
Carplay implementation on a Peugeot 205 using Raspberry PI and Carlinkit Dongle

## Hardware
Raspberry PI 4b <br>
Carlinkit <br>
Raspberry pi official 7" touchscreen <br>

For the moment, audio is managed by the original car radio but i plan to add an audio hat on the raspberry and make it manage audio part
This is the reason why only the “audio out“ is supported, the raspberry doesn't have an audio input for a microphone

## Software
The software part is on https://github.com/Chloedev5/pycarplay
